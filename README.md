### DOM
represents the page so that the programs can change the documnets structure, style and content displayed.

### Tree structure
HTML docs represented as a ree of nodes, including elements, atrributes and also text.

### Nodes in DOM
Node is a basic unit of a doc. A document is composed of a hierachy of nodes
types of nodes (elements, text and attributes)
elements = HTML , text = texts inside the elemets, atrributes = attributes of the HTML element.

### Navigation and Manipulation of DOM
1. Accessing nodes: getElementsbyId, getElementbyClassName, getElementsbyTagName
2. Manipulating nodes: For example, change text content, change atrributes, change styles, create and remove nodes
3. Create nodes: InsertBefore (), appendChild()
4. Node Relationships: i.e parent 'parentNode' and child 'childNode' nodes, other nodes include sibling nodes
